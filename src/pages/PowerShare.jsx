          PowerShare™ is a peer-to-peer mobile energy marketplace connecting CEERION EV owners with
          CPM-equipped sites. Hosts can request a Power Drop during extended outages or remote
          events; EV drivers fulfill the request and get paid. This extends the value of every
          CEERION Energy system into the community.
